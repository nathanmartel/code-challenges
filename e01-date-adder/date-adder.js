module.exports = (oldDate, diff) => {
  // Have a helper function for every unit of time in Date that takes in and adds two of the same units (oldDate, diff date) and returns any remainder
  // Check end of diff string for time unit
  // Convert diff to Date format
  // Call series of helper functions, passing result to the next-larger unit
  // Increment that unit, passing the recarrying any remainder over the cutoff to the next largest unit
  // Return string formed by chain of function calls.

  // Alternate, maybe simpler approach: convert oldDate and diff into smallest unit (milliseconds), add, and divide by units working smallest to largest. But Would that integer be too large for JS?
